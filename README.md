Box Rain Gauge
--------------

Rain Gauge is a tool to simplify the process of collecting detailed information from mysql database servers when specific conditions are triggered.  Collections are packaged and centralised in one place, with a convenient web interface to let you explore the data easily.  This tool uses a modified version of the percona toolkit script pt-stalk to handle collecting data from remote servers.
